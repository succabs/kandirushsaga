# Instructions
- The goal of the game is to get 180 academic credits before you run out of student allowance months. 
- You get credits by shooting at them. 
- You will lose allowance months if you crash into selvityspyyntö or credit or fail to shoot them before they hit the ground. 
- Be wary of plagiointisyytös. You can not shoot it. You can only pass through it on the pink area. If you touch it, it will make you lose instantly!
- Drinking beer gets you a student allowance month. Yay!

Detailed instructions are inside the game, but they are in Finnish.

# Why was this made?

To execute a fun idea and learn Javascript and Phaser. It all started from the pun in the name - Kandi means Bachelor and Candy Crush Saga is the popular game.

# How to run it?

1. Clone repository
2. npm -i
3. to run as dev: npm run development / to make distributable bundle file: npm run distribution
4. Open the server on your browser
5. have fun

# License?

MIT.

# Known problems

- For some reason, the development server does not work with safari on mac (at least that is the case with me). It gives error from one sound (maybe it's the .ogg format?). Nevertheless, with Chrome it works. Did not have any problems with Windows or Linux.



# TODO

- Sounds (gaudeamus igitur on game completion, kela sound after selvityspyyntö)
- More encounters, cause student life is full of them
- The graphics of the game are only temporary placeholders for now, got most of them from https://opengameart.org/ or made them myself with pain(t). Will update them if I get inspiration
- Minna Canth with student cap to completion screen
- Make the game work on safari
