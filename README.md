# Kandi Rush Saga
A Javascript canvas 2D top-down shooter.

This github repo is source code for a dead serious Javascript game in which you have to get 180 academic credits before you run out of student allowance months. You get credits by shooting at them. You will lose allowance months if you crash into selvityspyyntö or similar unfortunate event or fail to shoot them. Be wary of plagiointisyytös, it will make you lose instantly!

Move with left and right arrows, shoot with space. Works only on desktop.
