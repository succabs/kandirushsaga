# Kandi Rush Saga

A Javascript canvas 2D top-down shooter made with Phaser.

This github repo is source code for a dead serious Javascript game in which you have to get 180 academic credits before you run out of student allowance months. You get credits by shooting at them. You will lose allowance months if you crash into selvityspyyntö or similar unfortunate event or fail to shoot them. Be wary of plagiointisyytös, it will make you lose instantly!

Instructions are inside the game. They are in Finnish though.

The graphics of the game are only temporary placeholders for now, got most of them from https://opengameart.org/ or made them myself with pain(t). Will update them once I get the game logic and every occurence to work.

# Why was this made?

To execute a fun idea and learn Javascript and Phaser.

# How to run it?

1. Clone repository
2. npm -i
3. to run as dev: npm run development / to make distributable bundle file: npm run distribution
4. have fun

# License?

MIT.

# Known problems

For some reason, the development server does not work with safari on mac (at least that is the case with me). It gives error from one sound (maybe it's the .ogg format?). Nevertheless, with Chrome it works. Did not have any problems with Windows or Linux.

# TODO

- äänet (gaudeamus igitur pelin läpäistessä, kelaääni selvityspyynnön tuhoutuessa)
- lisää tapahtumia, koska opiskelijan elämä on tapahtumarikasta
- grafiikkaa
- voittoruutuun lakitettu minna canth taustalle
