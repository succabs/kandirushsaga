## Instructions

- The goal of the game is to get 180 academic credits before you run out of student allowance months.
- You get credits by shooting at them.
- You will lose allowance months if you crash into selvityspyyntö or credit or fail to shoot them before they hit the ground.
- Be wary of plagiointisyytös. You can not shoot it. You can only pass through it on the pink area. If you touch it, it will make you lose instantly!
- Drinking beer gets you a student allowance month. Yay!

Detailed instructions are inside the game, but they are in Finnish.
