# Kandi Rush Saga

A Javascript canvas 2D top-down shooter made with Phaser.

This github repo is source code for a dead serious Javascript game in which you have to get 180 academic credits before you run out of student allowance months. You get credits by shooting at them. You will lose allowance months if you crash into selvityspyyntö or similar unfortunate event or fail to shoot them. Be wary of plagiointisyytös, it will make you lose instantly!

Instructions for the game are in the html file.

The graphics of the game are only temporary placeholders, got most of them from https://opengameart.org/ or made them myself with pain. Will update them once I get the game logic to work.

# Why was this made?

To execute a fun idea and learn Javascript and Phaser.

# FAQ

## Why is it cluttered with so many things?

Well, that happens in student life.

## How am I supposed to cope with that?

You are not. Getting a degree is hard. Deal with it. But unlike in real life, this game lets you try again easily.

## What if I get both selvityspyyntö and plagiointisyytös at the same time?

That is harsh. See the other answers.
