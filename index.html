        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of the game is to get 180 student credits (opintopiste)
          before you run out of student allowance months (opintotukikuukausi).
        </p>
        <p>Use left and right arrows to move, spacebar to shoot.</p>
        <div class="instructionSections">
          <img src="images/3p.png" alt="Example of student credit" />
          <p>
            Numbers are student credits that you have to shoot to get them. The
            higher you shoot them, the better course number you get. That
            affects your total GPA (Keskiarvo).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="instructionSections">
          <img src="images/beer.png" alt="Beer" />
          <p>
            Since beer is healthy, it gives you +1 student allowance months.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="instructionSections">
          <img src="images/selvitys.png" alt="Selvityspyyntö" />
          <p>
            Selvityspyyntö has 5 health. Shoot it five times and it disappears.
            If it passes you or you get hit by it, you lose 25 student credits
            and 10 student allowance months.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="instructionSections">
          <img src="images/plagiointi.png" alt="Plagiointsyytös" />
          <p>
            You can't do anything about plagiointisyytös, but to pass it in the
            safe area somewhere inside it. If you get hit by it, you will lose
            the game.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Moodlen käyttökatko can hit you anytime. During that, you can't move
          or shoot for 4 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and if the game wasn't hard enough already, you lose one student
          allowance month every 10 seconds.

      <h4>FAQ</h4>
      <h4>Why is it cluttered with so many things?</h4>

      <p>Well, that happens in student life.</p>
      <h4>How am I supposed to cope with that?</h4>
      <p>
        You are not. Getting a degree is hard. Deal with it. But unlike in real
        life, this game lets you try again easily.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What if I get both selvityspyyntö and plagiointisyytös at the same time?
      </h4>
      <p>That is harsh. See the other answers.</p>
