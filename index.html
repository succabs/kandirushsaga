        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of the game is to get 180 student credits (opintopiste)
          before you run out of student allowance months (opintotukikuukausi).
        </p>
        <p>Use left and right arrows to move, spacebar to shoot.</p>
        <p>
          Numbers are student credits that you have to shoot to get them. The
          higher you shoot them, the better course number you get. That affects
          your total GPA (Keskiarvo).
        </p>
        <p>Since beer is healthy, it gives you +1 student allowance months.</p>
        <p>
          Selvityspyyntö has 5 health. Shoot it five times and it disappears. If
          it passes you or you get hit by it, you lose 25 student credits and 10
          student allowance months.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can't do anything about plagiointisyytös, but to pass it in the
          safe area. If you get hit by it, you will lose the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moodlen käyttökatko can hit you anytime. During that, you can't move
          or shoot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and if the game wasn't hard enough already, you lose one student
          allowance month every 10 seconds.

      <h4>FAQ</h4>
      <h4>Why is it cluttered with so many things?</h4>

      <p>Well, that happens in student life.</p>
      <h4>How am I supposed to cope with that?</h4>
      <p>
        You are not. Getting a degree is hard. Deal with it. But unlike in real
        life, this game lets you try again easily.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What if I get both selvityspyyntö and plagiointisyytös at the same time?
      </h4>
      <p>That is harsh. See the other answers.</p>
